This code is an expanded `density-matrix renormalization group
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group>`_
(DMRG) program, based on code written for a `tutorial
<http://simple-dmrg.readthedocs.org/>`_ given originally at the `2013
summer school on quantum spin liquids
<http://www.democritos.it/qsl2013/>`_, in Trieste, Italy.  It
implements DMRG its traditional formulation (i.e. without using matrix
product states).  DMRG is a numerical method that allows for the
efficient simulation of quantum model Hamiltonians.  Since it is a
low-entanglement approximation, it often works quite well for
one-dimensional systems, giving results that are nearly exact.
